I'm having trouble with a test for a new kata in my zshellcheck project. The test is in `pkg/katas/zc1005_test.go` and the kata is in `pkg/katas/zc1005.go`. The kata is supposed to detect the use of the `which` command and suggest `whence` instead.

The test is failing with the error `Expected 1 violations, got 0`. This means that the `checkZC1005` function is not finding the violation it should.

I've tried everything I can think of to fix this, including:

*   Adding logging to the `checkZC1005` function to see if it's being called.
*   Adding logging to the `ast.Walk` function to see what nodes are being visited.
*   Reverting all the changes I made to the parser and the lexer.

I'm completely stumped. Can someone please help me figure out what's wrong?
