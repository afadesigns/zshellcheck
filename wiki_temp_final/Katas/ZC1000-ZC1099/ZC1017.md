# ZC1017: Use `print -r` to print strings literally

## Description

When printing arbitrary strings or variable contents, especially those that might contain backslashes (`\`) or other characters that `echo` or `print` (without `-r`) could interpret as escape sequences, it is best practice to use `print -r`. The `print` built-in with the `-r` (raw) option ensures that backslashes are treated literally and are not interpreted as escape characters.

This guarantees that the output precisely matches the input, preventing unintended interpretations or formatting issues. The behavior of `echo` can vary significantly between different shells and even different versions of the same shell, making `print -r` a more reliable, predictable, and portable choice for literal output in Zsh scripts.

## Bad Example

```zsh
echo "Path: C:\Program Files"  # `echo` might interpret `\P` as an escape sequence, or simply print literally
echo "Hello\nWorld"           # `echo` may or may not interpret `\n` as a newline, depending on shell/version
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Using `print -r` for literal output, guaranteeing backslashes are printed as-is
print -r "Path: C:\Program Files" # Output: Path: C:\Program Files
print -r "Hello\\nWorld"          # Output: Hello\nWorld

# Using `print` (without -r) when escape sequence interpretation is desired
print "Hello\nWorld"           # Output:
                                 # Hello
                                 # World
```
