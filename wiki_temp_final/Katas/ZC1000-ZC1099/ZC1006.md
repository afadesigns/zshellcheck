# ZC1006: Prefer `[[` over `test` for tests

## Description

In Zsh, `[[...]]` is a more powerful, safer, and idiomatic conditional construct than the traditional `test` command or single brackets `[...]`. The primary advantages of `[[...]]` include:

*   **Intelligent Word Splitting and Globbing:** Unlike `[` or `test`, `[[...]]` does not perform word splitting or pathname expansion (globbing) on unquoted variables, avoiding many common pitfalls and unexpected behaviors. This means you generally don't need to quote variables within `[[...]]` unless you specifically want literal string matching for patterns that might otherwise be interpreted as globs.
*   **Zsh-Specific Features:** It supports Zsh-specific features like regular expression matching (`=~`), globbing with extended patterns (`==`), and compound conditions (`&&`, `||`).
*   **Built-in Efficiency:** `[[...]]` is a keyword, not an external command, making it often faster and more efficient.

Using `test` or `[` requires meticulous quoting of variables to prevent unintended word splitting and pathname expansion, which can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, or simply incorrect logic. For arithmetic comparisons, `((...))` is generally preferred (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1003 | ZC1003]]).

## Bad Example

```zsh
my_var="foo bar"
if [ -n $my_var ]; then echo "This might split into two arguments"; fi
# Expected to fail if $my_var contains spaces, or behave unexpectedly if it expands to a file glob.

file="my file.txt"
if [ -f $file ]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Will fail if 'my file.txt' is split

if test "$str1" = "$str2"; then echo "Strings are equal"; fi # Correctly quoted, but `[[...]]` is still preferred
```

## Good Example

```zsh
my_var="foo bar"
if [[ -n $my_var ]]; then echo "Correctly handles spaces and globs"; fi
# No quotes needed for $my_var, `[[...]]` handles it correctly.

file="my file.txt"
if [[ -f $file ]]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Safely handles spaces in file names

if [[ "$str1" = "$str2" ]]; then echo "Strings are equal"; fi

# Zsh-specific regex matching
if [[ "hello world" =~ "hello (.*)" ]]; then echo "Regex match!"; fi
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1006` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
