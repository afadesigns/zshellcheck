# ZC1010: Use `[[ ... ]]` instead of `[ ... ]`

## Description

In Zsh, `[[ ... ]]` is the preferred, more robust, and more feature-rich conditional construct compared to `[ ... ]` (which is typically an alias for the external `test` command or a shell built-in with similar behavior). The primary advantages of `[[...]]` include:

*   **Built-in Keyword:** `[[...]]` is a shell keyword, not an external command. This means it behaves more predictably and efficiently, without the overhead of invoking a separate process.
*   **Intelligent Word Splitting and Globbing:** `[[...]]` handles word splitting and pathname expansion (globbing) intelligently. You generally **do not need to quote variables** within `[[...]]` unless you specifically intend for literal string matching against patterns that might otherwise be interpreted as globs. This significantly reduces common scripting errors and improves robustness.
*   **Enhanced Features:** It offers Zsh-specific features and improved syntax:
    *   **Regular Expression Matching (`=~`):** Allows direct regex matching within the conditional.
    *   **Glob Pattern Matching:** Supports extended glob patterns without explicit glob qualifiers.
    *   **Logical Operators:** Uses C-style logical operators (`&&` for AND, `||` for OR) directly, avoiding the need for separate `-a` or `-o` flags which can have surprising precedence issues.

Using `[ ... ]` requires meticulous quoting of variables and expressions to prevent unintended word splitting and pathname expansion, which can lead to bugs, security vulnerabilities, or simply incorrect logic. For arithmetic comparisons, `((...))` is often more appropriate (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1003 | ZC1003]]).

## Bad Example

```zsh
my_string="hello world"
if [ -n $my_string ]; then echo "This might incorrectly split arguments"; fi
# Fails if $my_string contains spaces (e.g., test -n hello world) or expands to a glob pattern

file_path="/path/to/my file.txt"
if [ -f $file_path ]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Will fail if file_path has spaces and is unquoted

# Complex logic with -a (prone to precedence issues)
if [ $a -gt 10 -a $b -lt 20 ]; then echo "Range"; fi
```

## Good Example

```zsh
my_string="hello world"
if [[ -n $my_string ]]; then echo "Correctly handles spaces and globs"; fi
# No quotes needed for $my_string here, `[[...]]` handles it robustly.

file_path="/path/to/my file.txt"
if [[ -f $file_path ]]; then echo "File exists"; fi # Safely handles spaces in file names

# Clearer logical operators
if [[ $a -gt 10 && $b -lt 20 ]]; then echo "Range"; fi

# Regular expression matching
if [[ "$version" =~ "^v[0-9]+\.[0-9]+$" ]]; then echo "Valid version format"; fi
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1010` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
