# ZC1005: Use `whence` instead of `which`

## Description

In Zsh, `whence` is a built-in command that is significantly more powerful and accurate than the external `which` utility. `whence` reports exactly how Zsh will interpret a command, including whether it's an alias, a function, a built-in, or an executable found in your `PATH`. This provides a complete and reliable picture of command resolution within your current Zsh environment.

`which`, on the other hand, is an external utility that only searches your `PATH` for executable files. It will **not** show aliases, functions, or built-ins. This fundamental difference makes `which` unreliable for determining the actual command Zsh will execute within its rich environment, leading to potential confusion or incorrect assumptions.

Preferring `whence` ensures that your scripts accurately reflect Zsh's command lookup behavior and helps in debugging command resolution issues.

## Bad Example

```zsh
which ls            # Might show /bin/ls, but 'ls' could be an alias like 'ls --color=auto'
which my_zsh_function # Will never find Zsh functions or aliases
which git           # Might show /usr/bin/git, but 'git' could be a shell function or alias
```

## Good Example

```zsh
whence ls           # Shows if 'ls' is an alias, function, or executable
whence -c ls        # Provides more verbose, shell-like output (e.g., 'ls is alias ls --color=auto')
whence my_zsh_function # Correctly identifies Zsh functions
whence git          # Accurately shows the resolved command for 'git'
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1005` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
