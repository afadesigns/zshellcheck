# ZC1008: Use `$(())` for arithmetic operations

## Description

In Zsh, `$(())` is the preferred and most idiomatic syntax for **arithmetic expansion**. It allows for direct C-style arithmetic evaluation, returning the result of the expression without requiring external commands or explicit variable assignments for the result. Compared to alternatives like `expr` or `let`:

*   **Conciseness & Integration:** `$(())` is more compact and integrates seamlessly into other command substitutions or variable assignments.
*   **Efficiency:** It's a built-in shell feature, making it generally more efficient than invoking an external command like `expr`.
*   **Clarity:** It clearly signals an arithmetic context, improving script readability.

Using `expr` involves executing an external command, which adds overhead and can be less efficient for frequent operations. `let` is a built-in that performs arithmetic and assigns the result to a shell variable, but it doesn't directly return a value for use in pipelines or other command contexts, making `$(())` more versatile for expansion.

## Bad Example

```zsh
# Using expr (external command, less efficient)
val_expr=$(expr 10 + 5)
echo "Result from expr: $val_expr"

# Using let (assigns, doesn't return for expansion)
x=5; y=3
let "sum = x + y"
echo "Result from let: $sum"
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Using $((...)) for direct arithmetic expansion
val_arith=$(( 10 + 5 ))
echo "Result from arithmetic expansion: $val_arith"

x=5; y=3
sum_arith=$(( x + y ))
echo "Result from arithmetic expansion: $sum_arith"

# Example in a conditional context
if (( a > b )); then
  echo "a is greater than b"
fi
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1008` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
