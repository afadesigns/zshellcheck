# ZC1007: Avoid using `chmod 777`

## Description

Setting file or directory permissions to `777` (read, write, execute for owner, group, and others) is a significant security risk. It grants unrestricted access to everyone on the system, which can lead to:

*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** Confidential files can be read by anyone.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** Files can be altered or deleted by any user.
*   **Malicious Code Execution:** Executable files or scripts can be run by unauthorized individuals, potentially compromising the system.

Best practice dictates adhering to the **principle of least privilege**, meaning you should assign only the minimum necessary permissions. Here are recommended secure alternatives:

*   **For Directories:**
    *   `775` (rwx for owner/group, rx for others): Common for shared directories where group members need to create/delete files, but others only need to read/traverse.
    *   `770` (rwx for owner/group, no access for others): Stricter for sensitive shared directories.
    *   `755` (rwx for owner, rx for group/others): Standard for public web directories or user home directories.
*   **For Files:**
    *   `664` (rw for owner/group, r for others): Common for shared data files.
    *   `660` (rw for owner/group, no access for others): Stricter for sensitive shared files.
    *   `644` (rw for owner, r for group/others): Standard for configuration files or publicly readable data.
    *   `755` (rwx for owner, rx for group/others): Only for executable scripts.

## Bad Example

```zsh
chmod 777 sensitive_script.sh # Grants execute to everyone
chmod -R 777 public_html/     # Makes all files and subdirectories writable by everyone
```

## Good Example

```zsh
chmod 755 executable_script.zsh # Executable for owner, readable/executable for group and others
chmod 644 config.yaml          # Readable for everyone, writable only by owner
chmod -R 775 shared_project_data/ # Shared directory: group members can modify, others can read/traverse
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1007` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
