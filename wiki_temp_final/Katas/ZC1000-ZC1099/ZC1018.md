# ZC1018: Use `((...))` for C-style arithmetic instead of `expr`

## Description

This Kata strongly recommends using Zsh's native `((...))` arithmetic construct over the external `expr` command for all arithmetic operations and comparisons. The `((...))` syntax is a powerful, built-in feature that offers several key advantages:

*   **Efficiency:** As an internal shell built-in, `((...))` avoids the overhead of invoking an external `expr` process, leading to more efficient script execution, especially for frequent arithmetic.
*   **Readability & Conciseness:** `((...))` provides a clean, C-style syntax for arithmetic expressions, integer comparisons (e.g., `==`, `>`, `<=`), and variable assignments (including `++`, `--`, `+=`). This makes scripts easier to read and understand.
*   **Robustness (No Quoting Issues):** `expr` often requires careful and sometimes complex escaping of operators (e.g., `\*` for multiplication), and can be prone to word splitting issues if variables are not properly quoted. `((...))` handles variables and operators correctly within its context, eliminating these common pitfalls.

Consistent use of `((...))` significantly improves script performance, readability, and overall robustness by leveraging Zsh's native capabilities effectively.

## Bad Example

```zsh
x=10; y=5

# Using expr for arithmetic evaluation (external command, requires escaping)
value=$(expr $x \* $y + 5)
echo "Result from expr: $value"

# Using expr for comparison (external command, verbose redirection)
expr $x = $y > /dev/null
if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then echo "x equals y"; fi
```

## Good Example

```zsh
x=10; y=5

# Using ((...)) for direct arithmetic evaluation (more efficient, no escaping)
value=$(( x * y + 5 ))
echo "Result from arithmetic expansion: $value"

# Using ((...)) for C-style comparison (clearer, built-in)
if (( x == y )); then echo "x equals y"; fi

# Other operations
(( i++ )) # Increment
(( result = x / y )) # Assignment
```

## Configuration
