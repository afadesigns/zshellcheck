# ZC1002: Use $(...) instead of backticks

## Description

Backticks (`` `command` ``) for command substitution are an older, deprecated syntax with several significant disadvantages compared to `$(command)`. The `$(...)` form is the modern, preferred, and **POSIX-standard** way to perform command substitution in Zsh and other compatible shells. Preferring `$(...)` offers substantial benefits:

*   **Readability and Clarity:** `$(...)` clearly delimits the command being substituted, improving visual parsing and understanding of the script's logic.
*   **Arbitrary Nesting:** `$(...)` allows for arbitrary nesting of command substitutions without complex and error-prone backslash escaping. Backticks require cumbersome escaping (e.g., `` `echo \`date\`` ``) for nesting, which quickly becomes unmanageable.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** Backticks can sometimes be ambiguous with string literals or glob patterns, leading to unexpected behavior. `$(...)` avoids this ambiguity.
*   **Robustness:** Scripts using `$(...)` are generally more robust and less prone to subtle parsing errors across different shell environments or with complex inputs.

Adopting `$(...)` consistently leads to more readable, robust, and portable Zsh scripts.

## Bad Example

```zsh
# Old-style backticks
file_count=`ls | wc -l`
timestamp=`date +"%Y-%m-%d"`

# Difficult and error-prone nesting with backticks
nested_output=`echo \`date\``
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Modern and clear command substitution
file_count=$(ls | wc -l)
timestamp=$(date +"%Y-%m-%d")

# Easy and readable nesting with $(...)
nested_output=$(echo $(date))
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1002` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
