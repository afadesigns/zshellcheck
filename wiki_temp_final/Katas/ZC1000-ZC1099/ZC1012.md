# ZC1012: Use `read -r` to prevent backslash escaping

## Description

When using the `read` built-in command in Zsh (and other shells), it's crucial to use the `-r` option (`raw` mode). By default, `read` interprets backslashes (`\`) as escape characters, which can lead to unexpected behavior if the input contains backslashes (e.g., file paths, special characters, or multi-line input). The `-r` option prevents `read` from interpreting backslashes, ensuring that the input is stored literally as it was entered. This significantly improves script robustness and predictability, especially when reading user input or arbitrary data from files.

## Bad Example

```zsh
read -p "Enter a string (e.g., C:\Program Files or line1\\nline2): " user_input
echo "You entered: $user_input"
# If user enters "C:\Program Files", it might be interpreted as "C:Program Files"
# If user enters "line1\\nline2", it might be interpreted as "line1\nline2"
```

## Good Example

```zsh
read -r -p "Enter a string (e.g., C:\Program Files or line1\\nline2): " user_input
echo "You entered: $user_input"
# "C:\Program Files" is stored exactly as entered, "line1\\nline2" is stored as "line1\nline2"
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1012` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
