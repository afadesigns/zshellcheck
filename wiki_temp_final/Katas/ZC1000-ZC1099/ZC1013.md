# ZC1013: Use `((...))` for arithmetic operations instead of `let`

## Description

While `let` is a built-in command for performing arithmetic operations and assignments, Zsh's `((...))` construct offers a more modern, idiomatic, and versatile C-style syntax for arithmetic. Preferring `((...))` over `let` brings several benefits:

*   **C-style Syntax:** `((...))` provides a familiar C-like syntax for arithmetic expressions, which is often more intuitive for developers coming from other programming languages.
*   **Versatility:** It can be used directly for both arithmetic evaluation (where its exit status is based on the result) and assignments, including compound assignments (`+=`, `-=`) and increment/decrement operators (`++`, `--`).
*   **Readability:** `((...))` makes arithmetic expressions clearer and more concise, especially for complex calculations or when integrating with conditional logic.
*   **Efficiency:** As a built-in shell feature, `((...))` is generally efficient.

`let` can sometimes be less readable, especially when expressions involve multiple variables or operators, and might require more careful quoting. This Kata encourages consistency and readability by promoting `((...))` for all C-style arithmetic needs.

## Bad Example

```zsh
count=0
let count=count+1      # Less idiomatic, requires re-typing variable name

total=10
price=2
quantity=5
let "total = price * quantity" # More verbose quoting for expressions

# Using let for comparison (often less clear)
if let "x < 10"; then echo "x is less"; fi
```

## Good Example

```zsh
count=0
(( count++ ))          # Concise C-style increment
(( count += 5 ))       # Compound assignment

total=10
price=2
quantity=5
(( total = price * quantity )) # Clean assignment

# Using ((...)) for comparison (clearer exit status)
x=5
if (( x < 10 )); then echo "x is less"; fi
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1013` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
