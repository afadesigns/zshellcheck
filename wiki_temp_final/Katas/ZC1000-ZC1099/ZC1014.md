# ZC1014: Use `git switch` or `git restore` instead of `git checkout`

## Description

Git has introduced the specialized commands `git switch` and `git restore` to explicitly handle the distinct operations previously managed by the single, overloaded `git checkout` command. Adopting these newer commands offers significant benefits:

*   **Improved Clarity:** Each command now has a single, clear responsibility:
    *   `git switch`: Dedicated to changing branches.
    *   `git restore`: Dedicated to reverting modified files in the working tree or restoring files from the staging area.
*   **Reduced Ambiguity:** The original `git checkout` command had three main functions (switching branches, restoring working tree files, restoring staging index files), which could lead to confusion and accidental data loss. `git switch` and `git restore` eliminate this ambiguity.
*   **Modern Git Practices:** Using `git switch` and `git restore` aligns with current Git best practices, making scripts and workflows easier to understand and more resilient to future Git changes.

While scripts still using `git checkout` for these purposes remain functional, migrating to `git switch` and `git restore` improves readability, maintainability, and safety.

## Bad Example

```zsh
# Overloaded `git checkout` for switching branches
git checkout feature-branch

# Overloaded `git checkout` for discarding local changes (risky if not careful)
git checkout -- my_modified_file.txt

# Overloaded `git checkout` to restore a file from staging (less intuitive)
git checkout HEAD -- staged_file.txt
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Clearer `git switch` for changing branches
git switch feature-branch

# Clearer `git restore` for discarding local changes in the working tree
git restore my_modified_file.txt

# Clearer `git restore` to unstage a file (restore from index to working tree, often implicit)
git restore --staged another_file.txt

# Restore a specific file from a commit (equivalent to checkout <commit> -- <file>)
git restore --source=HEAD~1 file_from_prev_commit.txt
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1014` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
