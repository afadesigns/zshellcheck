# ZC1003: Use `((...))` for arithmetic comparisons instead of `[` or `test`

## Description

For pure **integer arithmetic comparisons** in Zsh, `((...))` provides a more natural, C-style syntax and often better performance and robustness than `[` or `test`. The `[[...]]` construct also supports arithmetic evaluation with `((...))`, but for direct integer comparisons, `((...))` is more idiomatic and efficient. Using `[` or `test` for arithmetic comparisons relies on external commands or string evaluation, which can be slower, less type-safe (as it treats numbers as strings), and prone to subtle quoting or parsing issues.

## Bad Example

```zsh
a=10; b=5
if [ "$a" -gt "$b" ]; then echo "a > b"; fi  # Relies on external `test` or `[` command
if test "$a" -le "$b"; then echo "a <= b"; fi # String comparison, potential issues with non-integers or edge cases
```

## Good Example

```zsh
a=10; b=5
if (( a > b )); then echo "a > b"; fi      # Direct integer arithmetic comparison
if (( a <= b )); then echo "a <= b"; fi   # Clearer, more performant, no quoting needed
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1003` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
