# ZC1001: Use ${} for array element access

## Description

In Zsh, accessing array elements using `$array[index]` can sometimes behave unexpectedly or be misinterpreted in complex expansions. The more explicit and safer syntax is `${array[index]}`, which clearly delimits the array access from surrounding text or other expansions. This ensures the correct element is accessed, especially when dealing with nested expansions or when the array name might be followed by characters that could be part of a variable name.

## Bad Example

```zsh
my_array=(alpha beta gamma)
echo $my_array[2]suffix # Might output "beta" then "suffix", or error
```

## Good Example

```zsh
my_array=(alpha beta gamma)
echo "The second element is ${my_array[2]}."
# Expected output: The second element is beta.

# Or, to safely concatenate:
echo "${my_array[2]}suffix" # Clearly outputs "betasuffix"
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1001` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
