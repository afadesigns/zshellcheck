# ZC1009: Use `((...))` for C-style arithmetic

## Description

In Zsh, the `((...))` construct is specifically designed for performing **C-style integer arithmetic evaluation and comparisons**. This is a powerful and efficient built-in mechanism to handle arithmetic directly within the shell, offering features like variable assignment, increment/decrement operators, and various logical/bitwise operations.

Key aspects of `((...))`:

*   **Conditional Context:** When used in a conditional context (e.g., `if (( ... ))`), `((...))` returns an exit status of `0` (true) if the arithmetic result is non-zero, and `1` (false) if the result is zero. This makes it ideal for conditional logic based on arithmetic.
*   **Efficiency:** As a built-in feature, it is generally more efficient than invoking external utilities like `expr`.
*   **Conciseness:** It provides a clean, C-like syntax for arithmetic operations.

This Kata promotes using `((...))` for arithmetic contexts where its **exit status** is relevant (e.g., in `if` or `while` statements) or for direct C-style assignments/increments. For cases where you need the **result of an arithmetic expression** as a value (e.g., to assign to another variable or use in a command substitution), the arithmetic expansion `$(())` is more appropriate (see [[Katas/ZC1000-ZC1099/ZC1008 | ZC1008]]).

## Bad Example

```zsh
# Using expr for a conditional check (external command, inefficient)
if expr $a + $b > /dev/null; then echo "Sum is non-zero"; fi

# Using let for incrementing (less idiomatic for C-style operation)
let i=i+1

# Performing comparison with [ (string comparison, error-prone)
if [ "$count" -lt 10 ]; then echo "Count is less than 10"; fi
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Using ((...)) for a conditional check based on arithmetic result
if (( a + b )); then echo "Sum is non-zero"; fi

# Using ((...)) for C-style increment/decrement
(( i++ ))
(( --j ))

# Using ((...)) for arithmetic comparison in a conditional context
count=5
if (( count < 10 )); then echo "Count is less than 10"; fi
if (( num_files >= 100 )); then echo "Many files!"; fi

# Direct assignment within ((...))
(( result = a * b ))
```

## Configuration

To disable this Kata, add `ZC1009` to the `disabled_katas` list in your `.zshellcheckrc` file.
