# ZC1011: Use `git` porcelain commands instead of plumbing commands

## Description

Git commands are broadly categorized into two main types:

*   **Porcelain commands:** These are high-level, user-friendly commands designed for common day-to-day operations (e.g., `git status`, `git commit`, `git pull`). Their output and behavior are generally stable across Git versions, making them reliable for scripting and user interaction.
*   **Plumbing commands:** These are low-level commands that interact directly with Git's internal data structures (e.g., `git hash-object`, `git cat-file`, `git update-index`). Their output and exact behavior can be more prone to change between Git versions, and they require a deeper understanding of Git's internals.

In typical shell scripts, it is **highly recommended to use porcelain commands** unless you have a very specific and well-understood need to interact with Git's internals. Relying on plumbing commands for common tasks can lead to fragile scripts that break with Git updates or are harder to understand and maintain.

## Bad Example

```zsh
# Using a plumbing command to get the current commit hash (less robust)
commit_hash=$(git rev-parse HEAD^{commit})

# Using an older or less direct method for current branch name
current_branch=$(git branch --show-current) # deprecated in some contexts / for older Git versions

# Using plumbing to check if a file is tracked (less readable)
is_tracked=$(git ls-files --error-unmatch -- "$file" &>/dev/null; echo $?)
```

## Good Example

```zsh
# Standard and robust way to get the current commit hash
commit_hash=$(git rev-parse HEAD)

# Recommended way to get the current branch name (porcelain)
current_branch=$(git rev-parse --abbrev-ref HEAD)

# Using porcelain to check if a file is tracked (more common and readable)
if git ls-files --error-unmatch -- "$file" &>/dev/null; then
  echo "$file is tracked"
else
  echo "$file is not tracked"
fi
```
