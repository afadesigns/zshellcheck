our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

*   Using welcoming and inclusive language
*   Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
*   Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
*   Focusing on what is best for the community
*   Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

*   The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
    advances
*   Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
*   Public or private harassment
*   Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
    address, without explicit permission
*   Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
    professional setting

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at [INSERT CONTACT METHOD]. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that

faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
