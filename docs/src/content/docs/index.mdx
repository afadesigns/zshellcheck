## Overview

`zshellcheck` is a static analysis tool (linter) specifically designed for Zsh scripts. Unlike `shellcheck`, which focuses on POSIX sh/bash compatibility, `zshellcheck` understands Zsh syntax, best practices, and common pitfalls.

It parses Zsh scripts into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST) and runs a series of checks ("Katas") to identify issues.
